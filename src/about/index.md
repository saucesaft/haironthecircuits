hello my name is Eduardo, people call me Lalo, but im better know as saucesaft on the internet. Im from the north of MÃ©xico so that's why i'll try to keep the languages balanced depending on the kind of post.

### Q&A

#### why saucesaft?
- sauce [in english] = thick _liquid_ served with food, usually savory dishes, to add moistness and flavor.
- saft [in german] = the _liquid_ obtained from or present in fruit or vegetables.

i mixed the words because i thought funny, thats it lol

#### why *hair on the circuits?*
white noise by noah baumbach - 1:00:21

i really liked the movie, it really sticked with me, it is just a reference to it :)

(also, the dialogue is actually hair *in* the circuits, but *on* looked better on the domain)
